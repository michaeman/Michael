### About
I'm Michael. I've loved technology since I was very young, at the age of 6 I received my first console, the Nintendo 64. This was the beginning of my everlasting bond with technology. 
Today, I have a degree in Computing and Software Systems and been learning new languages, features, and technologies to create stuff I always wanted. 

During my time at university, I gathered many experiences and skills in both developing and usability. The one I find most important to me is how it changed my philosophy when developing. Which is heavily linked to the UI and UX aspects of development. "It is easy to create a piece of software, the software may be complicated, it may be very useful, but hard to use. On the other hand, it is far more difficult to make something that is intuitive to the user, useful for the user, as well as being simple to use." I apply this philosophy when developing ever since, which made me more and more attracted to the usability aspect of the digital world. I also place great value in code neatness; keeping code well structured, object oriented designs; and UI's that are beautiful in both their appearance and function, and I think that a great looking app/website starts with good looking code. 

My current areas of interest include NodeJS and AngularJS development, and incorporating responsive design into my web interfaces using technologies like Bootstrap. I often obsess over the finer details as much as the big picture, applying a lot of care to everything from the structure of my code, to tiny details like placement of semicolons and variable names. Code should be modular and reusable, it should be well documented, and it should be well tested. I apply these three principles as often as I can to my programming.

This is a basic self project I've started during the 2015 winter break holidays, it is mainly to gain more experience in making responsive websites with the Ruby on Rails framework. It was a quick 24 hour marathon to play around with the emailing function which turned into something that was usable, I am still adding more features in it now and then. Need more front-end touches.
